# Cost 

You will be responsible for the cost of the AWS services used when running the solution. We recommend using the AWS Cost Explorer feature in the solution to help manage costs. Prices are subject to change. For full details, refer to the pricing webpage for each AWS service used in this solution.

The cost for running the Sensitive Data Protection solution varies based on the following factors:

- Number and size of datasets
- Number and complexity of data structures
- Frequency of discovery job updates

For example, a large datasets that is running discovery job with fully scan range will result in higher costs than smaller datasets with increased scan range and limited scan depth that are run on demand.

## Cost breakdown


As of June 2023, the cost for main AWS account running this solution with the default settings in China (Ningxia) Region Operated by NWCD is approximately Â¥901.82 CNY a month.
