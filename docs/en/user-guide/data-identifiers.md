A data identifier is a rule to detect sensitive data. The solution allows you to manage all the identifiers. You can view the built-in identifiers or create custom identifiers with RegEx or keywords.

## View built-in data identifiers
In the **Built-in data identifiers** tab, you can see a list of built-in data identifiers. For a full list, please see [Appendix - Built-in data identifiers](appendix-built-in-identifiers.md).

!!! note "Note"
    Some built-in data identifiers, such as person names and addresses, are defined based on AI, while others are defined based on Regex/keywords.

## View custom data identifiers
In the **Custom data identifiers** tab, you can see a list of custom data identifiers that you defined. The list is empty by default.

## Create custom data identifier
In the **Custom data identifiers** tab, choose **Create data identifier**. 

## Delete custom data identifier
In the **Custom data identifiers** tab, select a custom data identifier, choose **Delete**.
