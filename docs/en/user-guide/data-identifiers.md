# Manage data identifiers 
A data identifier is a rule to inspect sensitive data. On the **Manage data identifiers** webpage, you can manage all the identifiers. You can view the built-in identifiers or create identifiers of your own with Regex or keywords.

## View built-in data identifiers
In the **Built-in data identifiers** tab, you can see a list of built-in data identifiers. For a full list, please see Appendix - Built-in data identifers.

> Tips: Some built-in data identifiers, such as person names and addresses, are defined based on AI, while others are defined based on regex/keywords.

## View custom data identifiers
In the **Custom data identifiers** tab, you can see a list of custom data identifiers that you defined. The list is empty by default.

## Create custom data identifier
In the **Custom data identifiers** tab, click the **Create data identifier** button. 

## Delete custom data identifier
In the **Custom data identifers** tab, select a custom data identifer, click the **Detete** button.
