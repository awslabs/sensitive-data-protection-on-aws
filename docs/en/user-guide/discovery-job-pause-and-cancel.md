You can only pause or resume a scheduled job. It does NOT mean to pause or resume a running discovery job.

To pause a scheduled job, on the **Run Sensitive Data Discovery Jobs** page, click **Actions** and select **Pause**. For instance, if you scheduled a monthly job on the first day of every month and ran a job once in January, choosing Pause will prevent the discovery job from executing in February.

To resume a paused job, on the **Run Sensitive Data Discovery Jobs** page,click **Actions** and select **Continue**.
