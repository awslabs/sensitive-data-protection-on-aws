# Sensitive Data Discovery Job

## Pause/Continue a discovery Job
Pause/Continue can only be applied to a scheduled job. It does NOT mean to stop/resume a running discovery job.

To pause a scheduled job, on the **Run Sensitive Data Discovery Jobs** webpage, click **Actions** and select **Pause**. For instance, if you scheduled a monthly job on the first day of every month and ran a job once in January, choosing Pause will prevent the discovery job from executing in February.

To resume a paused job, on the **Run Sensitive Data Discovery Jobs** webpage,click **Actions** and select **Continue**.
