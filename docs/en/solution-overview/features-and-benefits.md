The Sensitive Data Protection on AWS (SDPS) provides the following features:

**Data discovery**: The solution automatically discovers various data stores, such as Amazon S3 and Amazon RDS, across multiple AWS accounts, allowing customers to easily create a data catalog and run sensitive data discovery jobs. The solution leverages not only pattern-based discovery but also ML classification based on deep learning NLP and NER.

**Flexible data classification**: Customers can define data classification templates for detecting privacy data, such as personal information. The solution enables customers to define their own custom sensitive data types or choose from over 200 built-in data types.

**Centralized data visualization**: The dashboards provide an overview of the data catalogs and sensitive data status, such as data location, data sources, etc.
