# Why you need the solution?
Discovering sensitive data is the primary challenge that enterprises face when it comes to implementing data protection measures. This task is often difficult due to various hurdles outlined in Figure 1.

The Sensitive Data Protection Solution is an AWS solution that provides a self-service web application allowing enterprise customers (e.g. Security team, Big data team) to create data catalogs, discover, protect, and visualize sensitive data, such as PII and classified data, across multiple AWS accounts (see Figure 2). The solution enables customers to perform regular or on-demand sensitive data discovery jobs using their own data classification templates. Customers can access metrics such as the total number of sensitive data entries stored in all their AWS accounts, which accounts contain the most sensitive data, and the data sourceÂ where the sensitive data is located. This eliminates the need for manual tagging to track sensitive data, providing a more automated approach to data protection.
