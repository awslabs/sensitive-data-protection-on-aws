This solution was designed with best practices from the [AWS Well-Architected Framework][well-architected-framework] which helps customers design and operate reliable, secure, efficient, and cost-effective workloads in the cloud.

This section describes how the design principles and best practices of the Well-Architected Framework were applied when building this solution.

## Operational excellence

This section describes how the principles and best practices of the [operational excellence pillar][operational-excellence-pillar] were applied when designing this solution.

The Sensitive Data Protection on AWS solution pushes metrics, logs and traces to Amazon CloudWatch at various stages to provide observability into the infrastructure, Elastic load balancer, Lambda functions, Step Function workflow and the rest of the solution components.

## Security

This section describes how the principles and best practices of the [security pillar][security-pillar] were applied when designing this solution.

- Sensitive Data Protection on AWS solution web console users are authenticated and authorized with Amazon Cognito or OpenID Connect.
- All inter-service communications use AWS IAM roles.
- All roles used by the solution follows least-privilege access. That is, it only contains minimum permissions required so the service can function properly.

## Reliability

This section describes how the principles and best practices of the [reliability pillar][reliability-pillar] were applied when designing this solution.

- Using AWS serverless services wherever possible (for example, Lambda, Step Functions, Amazon S3, and Amazon SQS) to ensure high availability and recovery from service failure.
- Scan result metadata is stored in Amazon RDS with multiple Availability Zones (AZs).

## Performance efficiency

This section describes how the principles and best practices of the [performance efficiency pillar][performance-efficiency-pillar] were applied when designing this solution.

- The ability to launch this solution in any Region that supports AWS services in this solution such as: Amazon S3, Elastic load balancer.
- Use Serverless architectures remove the need for you to run and maintain physical servers for traditional compute activities.
- Automatically testing and deploying this solution daily. Reviewing this solution by solution architects and subject matter experts for areas to experiment and improve.

## Cost optimization

This section describes how the principles and best practices of the [cost optimization pillar][cost-optimization-pillar] were applied when designing this solution.

- Use Autoscaling Group so that the compute costs are only related to how much data is ingested and processed.
- Using serverless services such as Amazon S3, Amazon Kinesis Data Streams, Amazon EMR Serverless and Amazon Redshift Serverless so that customers only get charged for what they use.

## Sustainability

This section describes how the principles and best practices of the [sustainability pillar][sustainability-pillar] were applied when designing this solution.

- The solutionâ€˜s use of managed services (such as Amazon Glue, Amazon Step Functions, Amazon Lambda) are aimed at reducing carbon footprint compared to the footprint of continually operating on-premises servers.
- The solution decouples senders and receivers of asynchronous messages by Amazon SQS.
