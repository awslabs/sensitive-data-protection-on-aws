To automate deployment, this solution uses the following AWS CloudFormation templates, which you can download before deployment:

 sensitive-data-protection.template: Use this template to launch the solution and all associated components. The default configuration deploys [AWS Lambda][lambda], [Amazon ECR][ecr], [Amazon Step Functions][step-functions], [AWS Glue][glue] and [Amazon SQS][sqs], but you can customize the template to meet your specific needs.

 [lambda]:https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/

 [step-functions]:https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/
 [glue]:https://aws.amazon.com/glue/
